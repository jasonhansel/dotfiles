# dotfiles

Instead of the typical workflow (using `stow`), these dotfiles
are meant to be used by (effectively) turning your home directory
into the working tree for a specific repository).

To set this up:
- Get the repo, move .git into a separate folder
- Update worktree config, checkout correct branch
- Get antigen and Plug.vim working
- PlugIntall
- Fix any remaining issues
